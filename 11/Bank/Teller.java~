	//this intricately thought-out line of code invokes the constructor, creating a default object of class BankAccount whose properties can be set later

	//here, we add in a modest sum of money for our new object A by calling the mutator method from BankAccount, allowing us to change the private instance variable and giving it the double value 1000.0

	//this calls the method auth, which returns a boolean based on whether or not both the argument  accountNum and pazz are equal to variables account and pazz respectively
	a.deposit(50.00);
	//here, we test the method deposit, whose only parameter is the double amount to be deposited, in this case 50.00, which returns true since it is a positive value and fits the if statement 
	a.withdraw(76.00);
	//now, we can test teh method withdraw, using double 76.00, and it returns true and prints the changes made, a clever design in their part
	a.toString();
	//lastly, we test toString, which has been overwritten to return all the values and credentials of our object
